# DeepWiki — Professional Codebase Documentation Generator

Generate comprehensive, professional documentation that explains **why** and **how**, not just **what**.

## What DeepWiki Generates

DeepWiki goes beyond file listings to create documentation that tells the story of your codebase:

### 📖 Documentation Types

- **Architecture Docs** — System design, components, data flow
- **API References** — Complete function signatures with examples
- **Module Guides** — How to use and extend each part
- **Data Schemas** — Type definitions and validation rules
- **Cookbooks** — Common tasks and solutions

### 🎯 Deep Analysis Features

- **Business Logic Extraction** — Understand what the code actually does
- **Pattern Recognition** — Identify architectural and design patterns
- **Data Flow Mapping** — Trace how data moves through the system
- **Decision Records** — Document why architectural choices were made
- **Code Examples** — Working examples for every API

## Claude Code Usage

Simply describe what documentation you need:

```bash
"Analyze this codebase and generate architecture documentation"
"Document all APIs with TypeScript signatures"
"Create a module guide for the auth system"
"Generate a data schema reference"
"Scan the code and create a cookbook for common tasks"
```

DeepWiki will read your actual code, not just filenames, to create comprehensive documentation.

## OpenClaw Usage

### Quick Scan
```
/deepwiki-scan [project-path]
```
Deep analysis: file content, business logic, patterns

### Full Documentation
```
/deepwiki-generate
```
Complete docs: architecture + API + modules + data + cookbook

### Specific Focus
```
/deepwiki-api              # API reference only
/deepwiki-architecture     # Architecture docs only
/deepwiki-modules         # Module guides only
/deepwiki-data            # Data schemas only
```

## For Detailed Guidance

See [SCAN_GUIDE.md](references/SCAN_GUIDE.md) for deep analysis methodology.
See [GENERATE_GUIDE.md](references/GENERATE_GUIDE.md) for documentation templates.

## What Makes DeepWiki Different

| Aspect | Basic Docs | DeepWiki |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Code understanding | "Has auth module" | "Auth flow: login → validate → token → session" |
| API docs | "Has login function" | Full signature + params + errors + examples |
| Architecture | "Uses React" | Component hierarchy + data flow + state management |
| Patterns | None identified | "Uses Compound Component pattern in BentoGrid" |
| Decisions | Not documented | "Chose this approach because..." |

## Best For

- 📚 Onboarding new team members
- 🔄 Understanding legacy codebases
- 📝 Preparing for AI context injection
- 🎓 Teaching others about your codebase
- 📦 Creating user-facing documentation

## Tips

1. **Be specific** — "Document the payment flow" vs "Document everything"
2. **Iterate** — Generate, review, then ask for refinements
3. **Focus** — Use `--focus=api` for API-only docs
4. **Examples matter** — DeepWiki includes runnable examples

## Integration

DeepWiki works great with:
- **Claude Code** — Context injection and code understanding
- **GitHub** — Documentation on push to main/PR
- **Onboarding** — New team member documentation
- **API Docs** — Public-facing API reference
